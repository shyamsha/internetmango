## Setup and Running

- Prerequisites
  - Node
  - MySQL (or Postgres / Sqlite / MSSQL)
- Clone repo `git clone git@github.com:awinabi/crate.git crate`
- Switch to `code` directory `cd code`
- Configurations
  - Modify `/api/src/config/database.json` for database credentials
  - Modify `/api/.env` for PORT (optional)
  - Modify `/web/.env` for PORT / API URL (optional)
- Setup
  - API: Install packages and database setup (migrations and seed) `cd api` and `npm run setup`
  - Webapp: Install packages `cd web` and `npm install`
- Development
  - Run API `cd api` and `npm start`, browse GraphiQL at http://localhost:8000/
  - Run Webapp `cd web` and `npm start`, browse webapp at http://localhost:3000/
- Production
  - Run API `cd api` and `npm run start:prod`, creates an optimized build in `build` directory and runs the server
  - Run Webapp `cd web` and `npm run start:prod`, creates an optimized build in `build` directory and runs the server

## Multi-package automation

- New developers are advised to run through the above 'setup and running' process before reading further.
- Optional multi-package automation for faster setup and easier dev environment initiation.
- No need to cd to sub-folders unless working with mobile or running a production build.
- Once Node, MySQL, repo clone and configuration are setup correctly
  - Switch to `code` directory `cd code`
  - Setup
    - Setup API, Webapp and Mobile with a single command `npm run setup`
  - Development
    - Run API and Webapp `npm start`, browse GraphiQL at http://localhost:8000/ and Webapp at http://localhost:8000/
    - Run API alone `npm start:api`, browse GraphiQL at http://localhost:8000/
    - Run Webapp alone `npm start:web`, browse webapp at http://localhost:3000/
